# NBA-2021-2022-Python-Analysis
There are 2 data sets in this repository, the data set I chose to use was
'22RegularNBAPlayerStats.csv', this file contains each players individual stats
from the 2021-2022 NBA regular season. These data sets were pulled from kaggle
at this address 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/nba-player-stats'.
